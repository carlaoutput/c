- Objects of class Flex allow a variable length string to be maintained.

- When the constructor for Flex is provided a c-string as a parameter, the Flex object created will have that string value.  If no parameter is provided, a default string consisting of exactly one space should be created.
- Flex should have an overload of the output operator (<<) that will display the string surrounded by stars (*).

- Flex also has a void function, cat, having one reference parameter of type Flex.  The function cat should append the string in that parameter to the end of the Flex object invoking cat.

- There is no established bound on the size of a Flex object, so dynamic storage allocation should be used.

- All Flex member data is private

On the next page show me the contents of flex.h and flex.cpp.  The use of the <cstring> functions we discussed in class is permitted.
